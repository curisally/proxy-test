# This Dockerfile is for Hugging Face Spaces to run a pre-built image.
# It assumes that 'vichus/proxy-checker:latest' has already been built and pushed to a container registry.

FROM vichus/proxy-checker:latest

# The port the application inside the pre-built image listens on.
# This should match the EXPOSE directive in the original Dockerfile and the app_port in README.md.
EXPOSE 5001

# The command to run the application, as defined in the pre-built image.
# This CMD might be inherited from the base image 'vichus/proxy-checker:latest'.
# If the base image already has a correct CMD or ENTRYPOINT, this line might be optional
# or could be set to the same CMD as in the original Dockerfile.
# For this application, the command is to run the Flask app.
